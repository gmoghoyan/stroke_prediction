Objective of the project: through descriptive, predictive and prescriptive analytics,

•	To identify potential causes of stroke

•	To conduct clustering to identify any trends (which factors seem to impact the likelihood of a stroke)

•	To build a model that predicts the likelihood of a stroke in patients
